# Justmop Task1 and Task2
The implementation of Task1 and Task2 is under this repository.

# Task1
The name of the django project is Task1. For this api project, I have created an app named currencyAPI under Task1 project.
The explanation of Task1 is provided under Task1/currencyAPI/readme file. You can reach it from [here](https://github.com/ertugrul0/justmop/blob/master/task1/currencyAPI/readme).
The file explains my codes in different files, so please refer to that file to be able to understand the django structure and models that I designed.
